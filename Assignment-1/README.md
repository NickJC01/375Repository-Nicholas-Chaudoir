# Assignment-1
I found this website which uses the WebGL framework to create an aquarium of jellyfish. It was written by a Savannah State U CS student back in 2008, and while I doubt I could make this with my current knowledge of WebGL and Web development, I hope that this course will give me a head-start in 3D-modeling so that I might be able to create something similar by the end of the year.

I chose this website because I really like how you can modify the scene parameters and play around with the webapp's performance, and it also looks very nice.
This program does a lot with very little in terms of computer resources. It's a very simple program, but it's very well done.
